Prerequisite
------------

The source code uses some features from C# 6.0 and thus requires a compiler
that supports them to build, e.g. Visual Studio 2015+ and Mono 4.2+.


How to Build
------------

Open `holdem.csproj` on Visual Studio or MonoDevelop (aka. Xamarin Studio),
or run `msbuild` or `xbuild` in this directory. The binary will be found in
`bin\Debug` or `bin\Release`, depending on the configuration of your choice.
